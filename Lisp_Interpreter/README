For the input string, please try not to type TAB or any other control characters. 
Although this program have tried to deal with it, it might not good enough to capture all cases.

The end symbol ('$' or '$$') must appear in the new line without any white space or other characters
after it. Otherwise, it consideres a misuse of dollar sign, and an error will be thrown out.

The List representation may not correct for some cases.

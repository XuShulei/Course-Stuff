1. Make sure the R is installed in the system.

2. Make sure the input datasets "Iris.csv", "Iris_Test.csv", 
	"income_TEST_FINAL.csv" "income_TRAIN_FINAL.csv" 
   are stored in the same directory as the source code I submitted.

3. For the IRIS dataset, run

/path/to/Rscripts testIRIS.r

For the income dataset, run

/path/to/Rscripts testIncome.r

The corresponding .csv file will be created in the same directory.
"iris_classification_l1" means the classification result of iris dataset
by using L1 (city block distance) distance metric. Same meaning for other
name of output file. 

Note that the program will test all possible values of k,
it might take few minuetes to finish. (shoud be less than 3 minutes)

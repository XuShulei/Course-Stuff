1. Make sure the R is installed in the system.

2. Make sure the input dataset "Iris.csv" and "income_NEW.csv" 
   is in the same directory as the source code I submitted.

3. For the IRIS dataset, run

Rscripts testIRIS.r

For the income dataset, run

Rscripts testIncome.r

The corresponding .csv file will be created.

Note that the second program (testIncome.r) might take 
around 6 mins to complete. (tested on stdlinux)
